# BufTune

## Integration Guide and Parameter Configuration
To support practical deployment, we provide a brief integration and tuning guideline for deploying \textit{BufTune} into existing DASH-based players. _BufTune_ operates as a lightweight module operating in conjunction with the ABR algorithm, reacting to playback dynamics in real time. It incorporates two mechanisms that adjust the buffer size in response to user interactions and playback dynamics. Shrink logic is triggered only if a seek event occurs and the target lies outside the current buffer, ensuring that buffer reduction happens only when playback continuity is likely to be disrupted by the seek. Enlarge logic is triggered when a fixed portion of the current buffer has been consumed. For example, if the current buffer is 10 segments, \textit{BufTune} re-evaluates enlargement after 5 segments have been played.

All key parameters used in _BufTune_, along with their default values and recommended tuning ranges, are described below. The aggressiveness of buffer shrinkage is governed by the decay coefficient $\beta$ (default: 0.3, Recommended Range: 0.1–0.4), while enlargement behavior is controlled by $\xi$ and $\delta$, which adjust the influence of bandwidth surplus and ensure a minimum growth step (defaults: 0.5 and 0.3; recommended ranges: 0.4–0.5 for $\xi$, 0.2–0.5 for $\delta$). These values have demonstrated stable performance across diverse ABR algorithms and content types in our evaluation. In addition, no additional bandwidth estimator is required, as \textit{BufTune} directly reuses the predictions already computed by the ABR algorithms.
